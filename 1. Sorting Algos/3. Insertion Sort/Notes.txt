Time Complexity

Worst Case (descending sorted) → O(n²)

Best Case (already sorted) → O(n)

Why Use Insertion Sort?

Adaptive:
Steps get reduced if the array is already sorted
(i.e., the number of swaps is reduced compared to bubble sort).

Stable Sorting Algorithm:
Maintains the relative order of equal elements.

Good for Smaller Values of n:
Works well when the array is partially sorted.
Often used as part of hybrid sorting algorithms.
